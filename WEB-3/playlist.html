                <h3>Playlist Summary</h3>
                <p> The creation, performance, significance, and even the
                    definition of <em>music vary according to culture</em> and social context. Indeed, throughout
                    history, some
                    new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including Beethoven's
                    Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825, early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore
                    punk in the 1980s.<span class="green orange">There are many types of music</span> , including
                    popular music, traditional music,
                    art music, music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such as chanteys. Music ranges
                    from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s,
                    through to spontaneously played improvisational music such as jazz, and avant-garde styles of
                    chance-based contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries.
